## Intro
Isaiah has always loved watching college basketball since he was a child. Every year, he watches the NCAA Tournament, also known as “March Madness”. The NCAA Tournament is a 68-team, single elimination tournament that decides the champion of college basketball for that season. The teams are divided into 4 separate brackets and the winner of each bracket then goes onto the “Final 4”. The Final 4 is widely regarded as one of the biggest stages in American sports as basketball fans from all over the nation watch these last 4 teams play on national television to decide the champion for the season

## Objective
Before the start of March Madness, ESPN hosts the annual tournament challenge, a contest that allows fans to submit completed brackets and predict which teams they believe will make it to the Final 4 and ultimately win the championship. For the 2022 Tournament Challenge, ESPN reported 17.3 million entries alone. Since starting this challenge at least a decade ago, nobody has ever filled out a perfect bracket by picking all 67 games correctly. In recent years, ESPN has ever offered cash prizes for the perfect bracket

Isaiah wants to enter the challenge and submit a perfect bracket, or at least get the Final 4 teams correct. He wants to use data to determine which teams will win games throughout the tournament. 

## Based on college basketball data from 2013 - 2019. The dataset was found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewsundberg/college-basketball-dataset?resource=download)
